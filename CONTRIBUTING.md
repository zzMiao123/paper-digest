# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution.

## Development Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install the project in editable mode with development tools:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

3. Copy the example configuration:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

## Local Checks

Run the full local verification loop before opening a pull request:

```bash
make check
make build
make release-check
```

For release-preparation pull requests, run the composed release dry run:

```bash
make release-dry-run
```

If a pull request is mostly documentation or policy work, you can use the
faster docs-only guardrail while iterating:

```bash
make docs-check
```

If a pull request changes issue forms, labels, saved replies, triage policy, or
release-lifecycle contract data, run the policy-only guardrail while iterating:

```bash
make policy-check
```

For a machine-readable policy report, use:

```bash
make policy-check-json
```

For a GitHub-step-summary-friendly policy Markdown report, use:

```bash
make policy-check-markdown
```

To write that same policy report to a stable file for CI upload or local
post-processing, use `python tools/check_policies.py --json-report-file
reports/policy-check-report.json`.

To re-render policy-check GitHub Actions annotations or Markdown from that JSON
artifact, use `python tools/render_policy_report.py
reports/policy-check-report.json --format github-annotations` or `python
tools/render_policy_report.py reports/policy-check-report.json --format
markdown`.

If you need the same guardrail in machine-readable form, use:

```bash
make docs-check-json
```

If you need the same guardrail as a GitHub-step-summary-friendly Markdown
report, use:

```bash
make docs-check-markdown
```

If you need the JSON report and Markdown summary persisted to files for
debugging or CI experiments, use `python tools/check_docs.py
--json-report-file reports/docs-check-report.json --markdown-report-file
reports/docs-check-summary.md`.

If you need to render GitHub Actions annotations or re-render Markdown from
that JSON artifact, use `python tools/render_docs_report.py
reports/docs-check-report.json --format github-annotations` or
`python tools/render_docs_report.py reports/docs-check-report.json --format
markdown` or `python tools/render_docs_report.py
reports/docs-check-report.json --format pr-comment`.

The current docs-check JSON artifact is schema v4 and carries stable `check_id`
values plus structured findings with `message`, `severity`, and best-effort
`path` / `line` / `end_line` metadata.
Most repository-local checks now emit those findings natively, so annotations do
not depend solely on legacy string parsing.
Markdown-section, issue-form, and workflow-template checks now also attach
source line ranges when their parser can resolve a stable origin.
The reusable Python verification workflow now also publishes a PR-comment body
artifact rendered from the same JSON report, and a trusted `workflow_run`
follows that CI run to mirror failing docs-check results into the pull request
thread from the default branch renderer.
The dedicated `Workflow Lint` CI job now also uses the same pinned
`make workflow-tools` + `make workflow-check` path as local workflow linting,
so `actionlint` version drift is not hidden behind different local/CI setup.

If you change quarterly-review or post-release lifecycle templates, sync the
managed lifecycle blocks first:

```bash
python tools/sync_lifecycle_docs.py
```

To generate a sample digest locally:

```bash
make run
```

To keep local commits clean, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To lint GitHub Actions workflows locally:

```bash
make workflow-tools
make workflow-check
```

`tools/check_workflows.py` looks for `actionlint` in `ACTIONLINT_BIN`, then
`.tools/actionlint/actionlint`, then `PATH`.
`make workflow-tools` installs the pinned `actionlint` release into
`.tools/actionlint/actionlint` and verifies its checksum before replacing the
repo-local binary.
`make workflow-check` validates workflow YAML with `actionlint`; `make check`
also runs the workflow contract suite, which verifies behavior wiring such as
permissions, triggers, artifact paths, and repo-local helper calls.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and explain the user-facing impact.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` when the change affects usage or release notes.
- Update `config.example.toml` and `docs/config-recipes.md` when common setup paths change.
- Update `docs/compatibility-matrix.md` when runtime, platform, or workflow support claims change.
- Update `docs/maintainer-guide.md` and `RELEASING.md` when workflows, release steps, or repository operations change.
- Update `docs/maintainer-operations-hub.md` when the maintainer docs set gains
  a new source-of-truth page or the maintainer navigation model changes.
- Keep repository-local Markdown links and heading anchors valid by running
  `make docs-check` when docs or policy pages move, and when GitHub issue forms
  or workflows reference repository docs. The same guardrail also checks that
  the README docs map, maintainer source-of-truth pages, and release-lifecycle
  docs stay aligned, and that maintainer issue summary templates do not drift
  from their source-of-truth docs. It also checks release-lifecycle cross-link
  fields, close-out rules, and default summary semantics across quarterly
  review, release-preparation, and post-release artifacts, using structured
  parsing of workflow body sections and issue-form fields against the repo-local
  schema in `tools/lifecycle_contracts.py` plus maintainer-doc registry
  contracts and docs-check repository-boundary config in
  `tools/docs_contracts.py`, plus generic repository-link resolution and anchor
  validation in `tools/docs_links.py`, plus generic source reading and
  workflow-section caching in `tools/docs_sources.py`, plus generic
  contract-assertion and text-normalization helpers in
  `tools/docs_assertions.py`, plus maintainer-doc registry checks in
  `tools/docs_registry_checks.py` and lifecycle contract executors in
  `tools/lifecycle_checks.py`, plus the declarative docs-check pipeline in
  `tools/docs_pipeline.py`, including phase report labels and
  command/reporting config plus JSON/Markdown report rendering, and it fails if
  managed lifecycle blocks were not re-synced. The shared GitHub Actions
  verification workflow now publishes that Markdown summary to the GitHub step
  summary, emits GitHub annotations through `tools/render_docs_report.py`, and
  uploads both report files as the `docs-check-report` artifact. A trusted
  `workflow_run` then re-renders the same PR-comment body from the JSON artifact
  before updating or deleting the PR comment. That JSON artifact now carries
  structured findings rather than only flat error strings, so annotations and
  PR diagnostics can use best-effort file/line locations when they are known.
- Update `tools/docs_contracts.py` in the same pull request when the README
  docs map, maintainer-operations hub source-of-truth table, maintainer guide
  governance-doc coverage rules, or docs-check repository reference / skip
  boundaries change.

  repository-link resolution, anchor validation, or Markdown/GitHub metadata
  reference checking behavior changes.

  `TextSource` reading, Markdown section lookup, or workflow-section caching
  behavior changes.
- Update `tools/docs_assertions.py` in the same pull request when the generic
  docs-contract field/item assertion wording or text-normalization behavior
  changes.
- Update `tools/docs_registry_checks.py` in the same pull request when the
  maintainer-doc registry alignment rule between README, the maintainer hub,
  and the maintainer guide changes.
- Update `tools/lifecycle_checks.py` in the same pull request when
  release-lifecycle, maintainer-issue, linkage, close-out, or summary-semantics
  contract execution changes.
- Update `tools/docs_pipeline.py` in the same pull request when docs-check
  execution order, shared context inputs, phase labels, exit-code/reporting
  behavior, failure-summary formatting, JSON report shape / finding schema, or the
  success-message template changes.
- Update `tools/check_policies.py` in the same pull request when adding,
  removing, or renaming a repo-local policy validator, so `make policy-check`
  remains the local source of truth for policy-contract schema validation.
- Update `tools/render_docs_report.py` in the same pull request when the
  docs-check JSON schema is consumed differently for GitHub annotations or
  Markdown re-rendering.

  `docs/branch-protection-policy.md`, `docs/repository-settings-checklist.md`,
  `docs/ruleset-policy.md`, and the referenced workflow files together when
  required checks, repository-settings cross-links, or PR-facing workflow
  names/triggers change.

  trusted docs-check PR comment workflow changes how it resolves workflow-run
  context, verifies artifact presence, or decides comment upsert/delete mode.
- Update `tools/sync_issue_labels.py` in the same pull request when managed
  GitHub label synchronization behavior changes for community triage or
  pull-request routing automation.

  compatibility, or release behavior.
- If docs or changelog updates are intentionally not needed, say so explicitly
  in the PR template instead of leaving the hygiene status ambiguous.
- If a substantial PR is intentionally not linked to an issue or proposal, say
  so explicitly in the PR template as well.

## Project Standards

- Python 3.12+ only.
- New code should be type-annotated.
- Total coverage must stay at or above the repository floor enforced by `coverage`.
- User-visible failures should produce actionable error messages.
- Network integrations should be deterministic enough for unit tests to mock.
